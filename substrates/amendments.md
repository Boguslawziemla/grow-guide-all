# 🧪 Substrate Amendments: What They Are & How They Work

**Amendments** are extra ingredients added to a substrate to improve:
- Nutrition (🧠 faster, bigger growth)
- Structure (💨 airflow, colonization speed)
- Chemistry (🛡️ pH stability, mold resistance)
- Water retention (💧 consistency)
- Microbiology (🦠 better environment, more resilience)

Each one has a **role** — and a **risk** if misused.

## 🧂 Buffers & pH Stabilizers

---

### **Gypsum (Calcium Sulfate – CaSO₄)**

**What it does:**  
- Adds calcium & sulfur (micronutrients)  
- Improves structure (prevents clumping)  
- Stabilizes pH slightly without over-alkalizing  
- Supports healthy mycelium growth

**Recommended:** `5–10% of substrate mix`  
**Best for:** All levels  
**🔴 Avoid:** Overuse in already alkaline mixes (e.g. with CaCO₃)

---

### **Calcium Carbonate (CaCO₃)**  
(aka lime, oyster shell flour, chalk)

**What it does:**  
- Raises pH (more alkaline)  
- Prevents bacterial bloom in acidic substrates  
- Supports fruit body development in some strains

**Recommended:** `1–5%` (carefully)  
**Best for:** BRF cakes, acidic mixes  
**🔴 Avoid:** High amounts in CVG or coir-based mixes (can swing pH too far)

---

## 🍽️ Nutrient Boosters (Nitrogen-rich)

---

### **Worm Castings**

**What it does:**  
- Adds organic nitrogen, enzymes, trace minerals  
- Boosts fruiting potential  
- Encourages beneficial microbes

**Recommended:** `2–5% (max 10%)`  
**Best for:** Intermediate, advanced  
**🔴 Avoid:** Using fresh castings or >10% (too wet, too rich → bacteria)

---

### **Soy Hulls / Cottonseed Meal / Seed Meals**

**What it does:**  
- High nitrogen + amino acids  
- Supercharges fruiting  
- Often used in "master mixes"

**Recommended:** `5–10%`  
**Best for:** Advanced (sterile only)  
**🔴 Must sterilize** — these ingredients contam easily when pasteurized

---

### **Bran (Wheat or Rice Bran)**

**What it does:**  
- Adds proteins, B vitamins, minerals  
- Major nutrition booster  
- Common in sawdust-based substrates

**Recommended:** `5–15% (max)`  
**Best for:** Advanced  
**🔴 Sterilize always** — it’s a contam magnet otherwise

---

### **Coffee Grounds**

**What it does:**  
- High nitrogen  
- Easy to source  
- Adds fungal-active compounds

**Recommended:** `<5% if pasteurized`  
**Best for:** Advanced only (or outdoor grows)  
**🔴 Wet + nitrogen = bacterial soup** — pasteurize or sterilize

---

## 🧼 Structural Amendments

---

### **Biochar / Charcoal (fine)**

**What it does:**  
- Improves aeration  
- Holds water + nutrients  
- Creates microbial habitat  
- Adds trace minerals

**Recommended:** `2–5%`  
**Best for:** All levels  
**🔴 Must be fully cooled, crushed, and rinsed if DIY (remove ash)**

---

### **Straw (Chopped)**

**What it does:**  
- Adds carbon and texture  
- Breaks up dense substrates  
- Mycelium loves the cellulose

**Recommended:** `10–30%`  
**Best for:** Beginner/intermediate  
**🔴 Pasteurize to kill mold spores**

---

### **Sawdust (Hardwood preferred)**

**What it does:**  
- High-carbon structure  
- Slow food for long colonization  
- Often mixed with bran or soy hulls

**Recommended:** `30–60%` in advanced recipes  
**Best for:** Advanced (especially woodlovers)  
**🔴 Must be fine/coarse mix. Too fine = no airflow**

---

### **Perlite (optional)**

**What it does:**  
- Adds air pockets  
- Holds water without rotting  
- Used more in casing layers, not primary substrate

**Recommended:** `5–10% max`  
**Best for:** Intermediates in dry climates  
**🔴 Not always necessary in bulk substrates (coir + verm already work well)**

---

## 💧 Water-Retention Agents

---

### **Vermiculite**

**What it does:**  
- Holds water in small pockets  
- Prevents substrate drying  
- Used in BRF cakes and CVG

**Recommended:** `20–40% of volume`  
**Best for:** All levels  
**🔴 Don’t hydrate separately — mix into coir before water test**

---

### **Coco Coir**

**What it does:**  
- Core bulk base + water sponge  
- Resistant to contamination  
- Inert, stable, reusable

**Recommended:** `30–70%` in almost all teks  
**Best for:** Everyone  
**🔴 Keep coir brick-to-water ratio controlled (avoid over-wet mess)`

---

## 🛡️ Microbial Modifiers / Additives

---

### **Compost (Fully Aged)**

**What it does:**  
- Full-spectrum nutrients  
- Supports beneficial microbes  
- Adds bulk and complexity

**Recommended:** `10–30% (outdoor), 5–10% (indoor)`  
**Best for:** Intermediate/outdoor growers  
**🔴 Must be fully broken down + pasteurized**

---

### **EM-1 / Effective Microbes**

**What it does:**  
- Introduces lacto + yeast + phototrophs  
- Can help colonization and fight contams

**Recommended:** a few drops per 1L substrate  
**Best for:** Experimental/advanced  
**🔴 Use only with stable, well-tested recipes**

## ✅ Tips

- Amendments = power. Use with intention.  
- Don’t mix more than **3–4 high-N ingredients** together  
- **Always match the amendment to your pasteurization/sterilization level**
