## 📦 Core Amendment Table

| Amendment        | Function                | Dosage       | Grower Level | Sterilization | ⚠️ Notes |
|------------------|-------------------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|----------|
| **Gypsum (CaSO₄)**     | Calcium + sulfur + buffer | 5–10%        | All          | ❌ No           | Improves structure + mycelium health |
| **Calcium Carbonate (CaCO₃)** | Raises pH                 | 1–5%         | Beginner+    | ❌ No           | For acidic substrates; avoid overuse |
| **Worm Castings**      | Nitrogen + minerals        | 2–5% (10% max) | Intermediate | ❌ Pasteurize   | Too much = wet, contamination risk |
| **Coffee Grounds**     | High nitrogen + stimulant   | <5%          | Advanced     | ✅ Yes          | 🔴 Contam-prone if unsterile |
| **Bran (Wheat/Rice)**  | Protein + B-vitamins        | 5–15%       | Advanced     | ✅ Yes          | Always sterilize; contam magnet |
| **Soy Hulls / Seed Meals** | Protein + bulk              | 5–10%       | Advanced     | ✅ Yes          | Best with hardwood sawdust |
| **Straw (chopped)**    | Structure + cellulose        | 10–30%      | All          | ❌ Pasteurize   | Pasteurize before use |
| **Biochar**            | Aeration + microbe habitat  | 2–5%        | All          | ❌ No           | Rinse if homemade |
| **Sawdust (Hardwood)** | Woody structure, high C     | 30–60%      | Advanced     | ✅ / ❌          | Pasteurize or sterilize depending on mix |
| **Perlite**            | Water + air balance         | 5–10%       | Intermediate | ❌ No           | Optional for dry climates |
| **Vermiculite**        | Water retention             | 20–40%      | All          | ❌ No           | Holds moisture; inert |
| **Compost (Aged)**     | Full nutrient spectrum      | 5–30%       | Intermediate | ❌ Pasteurize   | Must be mature and well-aged |
| **EM-1 / Microbials**  | Biological balance booster  | Few drops/L | Advanced     | ❌ No           | For experimental setups |

## 🔴 Red Flag Ingredients – Use With Caution

| Ingredient     | Why it's risky                | Tip                       |
|----------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Coffee Grounds | Too much nitrogen + moisture  | Use <5%, sterilize always |
| Bran           | Very nutritious = contam risk | Only for sterile grows    |
| Castings       | Easy to overuse               | Keep below 10%            |
| Compost        | Inconsistent content          | Use aged + pasteurized    |

## ✅ Tips for Success

- Stick to **1–3 amendments max** unless advanced.
- Always **match your prep method** to the risk (pasteurize vs sterilize).
- If in doubt, go with **coir + verm + gypsum** — it’s foolproof.
