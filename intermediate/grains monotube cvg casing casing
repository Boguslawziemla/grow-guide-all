# ♻ Intermediate Grow: Grain Spawn + Monotub (CVG + Casing Layer)

Welcome to the **intermediate level** of mushroom cultivation. This guide uses sterilized grain spawn and a bulk substrate (CVG = coco coir, vermiculite, gypsum) inside a **75L monotub** for big yields, strong stability, and far fewer failures than beginner cake setups.

## 🛠️ What You Need

### 🛠️ Equipment:
| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| 75L Monotub | Clear tote with loose lid or FAE holes |
| Pressure cooker | Required for sterilizing grains |
| Mixing bucket | For substrate hydration |
| Spray bottle | For misting (minimal needed) |
| Gloves, alcohol | For clean handling |
| Digital thermometer/hygrometer | Optional but useful |

### 💉 Materials:
| Ingredient | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Grain (millet, rye, oats) | For colonization (spawn) |
| Coco coir | Main bulk material |
| Vermiculite | Water retention |
| Gypsum | Mineral + structure |
| Optional casing layer | Protects and improves pinning |
| Spore syringe or LC | To inoculate grain jars |

---

## 📦 Tub Size Matters (Choose 75L+)

| Small Tubs (<30L) | 75L+ Monotubs |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Dry out fast      | Stable humidity |
| More contamination| Resilient microclimate |
| Less yield        | Bigger surface area |
| More babysitting  | Set and forget-friendly |

> 💡 A properly maintained 75L tub can yield **100–300g dry** over 2–3 flushes. Start right = win big.

## 🍚 Step 1: Grain Spawn Preparation

**Quick Overview:**
1. **Rinse grains thoroughly**
   - 🔴 *Dirty water = contamination risk*
   - Rinse with fresh water **at least 5–7 times** until water runs clear
2. Soak 12–24h in clean water
3. Simmer ~15–30 mins until plump but not bursting
4. Dry grains on a towel until surface is fully dry
5. Load into jars or bags, pressure cook at 15 PSI for 90–120 minutes
6. Inoculate with spore syringe or LC (1–2 ml per jar)
7. Shake jars once at 30–50% colonization
8. Wait until fully white, dense, and fresh-smelling

🔴 **Red Dot:**  
- Cloudy rinse water = **keep rinsing**  
- Wet, sticky, or sour-smelling jars = **contaminated** → discard

## 🌱 Step 2: CVG Substrate Prep

> 📄 See `pasteurization.md` for deep details

**Basic Recipe:**
- 650g coco coir  
- 1500g vermiculite  
- 10g gypsum (approx. 1 heaped tablespoon)  
- 4000–5000 mL boiling water

**Steps:**
1. Add dry materials to a clean bucket
2. Pour in boiling water
3. Stir and seal the lid tightly
4. Let sit for 4–6 hours
5. Open, mix, and test moisture level

## 💧 How to Measure Proper Field Capacity

**Field capacity** means your substrate is hydrated *just enough* — not too dry, not too wet.

🔬 Ideal range: **60–65% water content by weight**

### 🧪 Method 1: The Squeeze Test (Corrected)
- Take a handful of substrate  
- Lightly squeeze it (like wringing a sponge *gently*)  
- ✅ It should feel moist, cold, and release **no dripping water**
- If you squeeze harder: **a few drops may appear, but not stream**

🔴 *If water streams out or puddles when squeezed lightly = overhydrated.*

### ⚖️ Method 2: Weigh-Based Field Capacity (Accurate)
1. Weigh dry substrate (e.g. 1000g coir + verm mix)
2. Add water gradually while mixing
3. Keep weighing until your **total weight = 1600–1650g**  
   - That’s **60–65% water content**

## 🌿 Step 3: Optional Casing Layer (Highly Recommended)

**What is it?**  
A thin, non-nutritive top layer that helps regulate moisture, improves pinning, and protects the mycelium.

**Why use it?**
- Keeps surface hydrated without drowning pins
- Encourages even pin set
- Shields surface from contamination
- Reduces side and bottom pinning

### Basic Casing Mix:
- 50% peat moss or coir  
- 50% vermiculite  
- Optional: pinch of CaCO₃ (pH buffer)

**Hydrate to field capacity**, pasteurize if possible, then apply:
- Depth: 0.5–1.0 cm
- Add after substrate colonizes *or* right after spawning
- Mist gently to keep moist — not wet

🔴 Don’t pack it — **keep it fluffy**

> 💡 A casing layer is like mulch for mushrooms — soft, moist, protective, and clean.

## 🐣 Step 4: Spawn to Bulk

1. Clean tub and tools with 70% alcohol
2. Mix colonized grain spawn with CVG
   - **1:1 or 1:2** spawn-to-bulk ratio
3. Layering: bottom CVG → spawn → top CVG → optional casing
4. Flatten gently to avoid air pockets
5. Lid on loosely (or micropore-taped holes)

**Colonization phase:**
- Temp: 21–24°C  
- Light: optional  
- Air: low FAE (closed tub)  
- Time: ~10–14 days

🔴 Don’t open tub early — every peek raises risk of contamination

---

## 💡 Step 5: Fruiting Conditions

When surface is 100% colonized:
1. Flip or crack the lid for FAE
2. Mist casing layer only if dry
3. Maintain RH: **85–95%**
4. 12/12 light cycle (LED, indirect sunlight)

Pins appear in 5–10 days  
Harvest just before veil breaks

🔴 Too much misting = bacteria & rot  
Surface should **glisten, not puddle**

---

## 🔁 Step 6: Flushing

After harvest:
- Pour 1000–2000 mL clean water into tub (avoid direct soaking if casing is fragile)
- Let sit 4–6 hours
- Drain fully
- Resume fruiting conditions

Expect 2–4 flushes  
1st flush is usually 60–70% of total weight

## 🔴 Red Dot Trouble Zones

| Mistake | 🔴 Why It Fails |
|---------|----------------|
| Not rinsing grains enough | Traps bacteria → jar rots |
| Coir too wet | Leads to green mold |
| Small tub + no liner | Wild humidity swings, side pins |
| No casing in warm room | Top dries out, pins abort |
| Incomplete colonization | Weak flush or contamination |
| Poor air exchange | Long stems, no caps |

## 🧠 Tips from the Trenches (10 Years of Failures)

- Always rinse grains **until water is clear**  
- Casing layer = nature’s protective blanket  
- Bigger tubs = more success, more mushrooms  
- Don’t touch your tub unless you absolutely must  
- Good light → better pinning and growth  
- Watch the **smell** — earthy = good, sour = toss  
- Liner inside the tub prevents side pinning  
- Field capacity is a *feel*, not a number — squeeze test everything
