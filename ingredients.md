# 🧪 Substrate Ingredients & Their Roles

Understanding your ingredients is key to growing healthy, high-yield mushrooms. Below are the most commonly used substrate components for *Psilocybe cubensis* cultivation — explained in simple terms, with both poor and professional options.

---

## 🟤 COCO COIR  
**Role:** Base material for bulk substrate  
**Why it's used:** Lightweight, holds moisture well, and resists contamination  
**Notes:** Made from shredded coconut husks. Great for beginners and pros.

- 🪙 Cheap: compressed bricks (pet shops, garden stores)
- 💰 Pro: pre-buffered coir, lab-grade

---

## 🟡 VERMICULITE  
**Role:** Water retention and aeration  
**Why it's used:** Helps keep the substrate light and moist  
**Notes:** Inert mineral that absorbs water like a sponge. Used in BRF cakes and bulk.

- 🪙 Cheap: garden-grade fine vermiculite  
- 💰 Pro: mixed fine/coarse vermiculite for better structure

---

## 💩 MANURE (COW, HORSE, ETC.)  
**Role:** Nitrogen and organic nutrients  
**Why it's used:** Provides nutrition for high yields  
**Notes:** Must be **aged** or **pasteurized**. Great for advanced growers and commercial ops.

- 🪙 Cheap: local farms, dried patties  
- 💰 Pro: exotic zoo manure (elephant, giraffe)

---

## 🌾 STRAW  
**Role:** Carbon-rich base for colonization  
**Why it's used:** Easy for mycelium to digest  
**Notes:** Needs to be chopped and pasteurized. Can be used alone or mixed with manure/coir.

- 🪙 Cheap: free from farmers or pet bedding  
- 💰 Pro: sterilized straw pellets

---

## ⚪️ GYPSUM (CaSO₄)  
**Role:** Calcium and sulfur source; pH buffer  
**Why it's used:** Improves structure and mycelium health  
**Notes:** Especially helpful when using high-manure substrates.

- 🪙 Cheap: construction-grade gypsum  
- 💰 Pro: food-grade powdered gypsum

---

## 🐛 WORM CASTINGS  
**Role:** Rich micro-nutrient additive  
**Why it's used:** Boosts biological activity and yields  
**Notes:** Often used in small doses to supercharge coir mixes.

- 🪙 Cheap: home vermicompost bin  
- 💰 Pro: commercial castings (1–10% of substrate mix)

---

## 🌑 BIOCHAR / CHARCOAL  
**Role:** Enhances structure, water retention, and microbial health  
**Why it's used:** Mycelium loves biochar in small amounts  
**Notes:** Must be finely ground. Adds complexity and aeration.

- 🪙 Cheap: DIY from firewood  
- 💰 Pro: activated horticultural biochar

---

## ☕️ COFFEE GROUNDS  
**Role:** Nitrogen and trace minerals  
**Why it's used:** Boosts nutrition in small amounts  
**Notes:** Can introduce contamination if overused. Always pasteurize or mix with coir.

- 🪙 Cheap: cafés, your kitchen  
- 💰 Pro: sterilized dried coffee flour

---

## 🧂 CALCIUM CARBONATE (CaCO₃)  
**Role:** Balances pH  
**Why it's used:** Prevents acidity that favors contaminants  
**Notes:** Especially useful in BRF cakes or PF tek.

- 🪙 Cheap: crushed eggshells, chalk  
- 💰 Pro: food-grade oyster shell flour

---

## 💧 WATER  
**Role:** Vital for mycelium metabolism  
**Why it's used:** All substrate must reach field capacity (~60% moisture)  
**Notes:** Use clean or boiled water. Not too wet, not too dry.

- 🪙 Tip: Squeeze a handful — only 1–2 drops should come out. That’s field capacity.
