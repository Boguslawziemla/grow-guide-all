# ⚖️ Measuring Substrate Ingredients Correctly

**80% of beginner fails** happen in this stage. Let's fix that.

## 🧪 Basic Rule: Always Know Your Measurement System

Mushroom growing uses:
- **Volume** = liters, cups, quarts (coir, vermiculite, water)
- **Weight** = grams or kilograms (gypsum, additives, manure)
- **Moisture content** = Field capacity (see below)

### 📏 Key Conversions
| Measurement | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| 1 quart     | ≈ 950 ml |
| 1 liter     | ≈ 4.2 cups |
| 1 cup       | ≈ 240 ml |
| 650g coir brick | ≈ 8–9 quarts hydrated |

## 🔴 Where Most People Screw Up

| ❌ Mistake | 🔥 Why it matters |
|-----------|------------------|
| "Eyeballing" water | Leads to too wet substrate → trichoderma mold |
| Using *volume* for powdered ingredients (gypsum, CaCO₃) | Gives inconsistent results. Use weight (grams)! |
| Not accounting for coir expansion | One brick becomes 8–9 quarts — be ready. |
| Adding worm castings "generously" | They’re powerful — overuse causes contamination. Use 1–10%. |
| Packing substrate too tightly | Reduces airflow → suffocates mycelium |

## 💧 Field Capacity (MOST IMPORTANT SKILL)

This is how much water the substrate should hold.  
Too wet = bacteria. Too dry = stalling.

### 🧪 Field Capacity Test:
1. Grab a handful of mixed substrate.
2. Squeeze it hard.
   - ✅ **Perfect:** 1–2 drops of water come out.
   - ❌ **Too Wet:** Water streams out.
   - ❌ **Too Dry:** Crumbles apart.

> 🔴 **This is where 90% of beginners mess up.** Practice it until you get the squeeze right.

## 🪣 Bucket Tek Proportions (CVG Example)

**Easy measurement with household stuff:**

| Ingredient     | Volume (cups) | Notes |
|----------------|---------------|-------|
| Coco Coir      | 8 cups (1 brick dry) | expands to 8–9 qt wet |
| Vermiculite    | 4 cups        | helps water retention |
| Gypsum         | 2 tablespoons | weighed = ~15–20g |
| Water (hot)    | 4 liters      | boiling water to hydrate |

> ✅ Mix in bucket. Let sit for 4+ hrs sealed.
> 🔴 Test field capacity before using!

## 🧠 Tips to Get It Right

- Use **a digital scale** for powders and amendments.
- Use **measuring cups or pitchers** — not old yogurt containers.
- When in doubt, **go drier** and mist later.

## 🛠 Advanced: Moisture by Weight

Want to get pro?

```bash
Target water content: 60%
Total weight x 0.6 = water needed
Example:
2 kg substrate → 1.2 L water
