# grow-guide-all# 🍄 Psilocybe cubensis Grow Guide

This repository contains an open-source guide to cultivating *Psilocybe cubensis* mushrooms for healing, ceremony, microdosing, and personal development. As Mexico moves toward legal recognition of psilocybin, this guide is meant to empower communities — from rural growers with limited tools, to advanced labs and future psychedelic retreat centers.

### ✨ Why This Exists

- 🌱 To make mushroom growing knowledge free and accessible to all
- 🛠 To preserve traditional knowledge and modern techniques in one place
- 🇲🇽 To support legal reform and local independence in Mexico and beyond
